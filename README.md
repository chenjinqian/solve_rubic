It have been proved that any rubic cube can be solved within 20 steps, with the aid of computer.
My goal is
1, to repeat that prove,
2, and try to give a prove in theory, for general situation.
3, solve some other problem I came up with rubic cube.
4, publish the result on my blog, and provide interactive damonstration.

I have been considering this since 2013, and have not done yet.
